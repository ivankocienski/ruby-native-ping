# Ping in Native Ruby

Based loosely on code by arton (?) who I have lost the URL to.

It is by no means representative of 'Good Ruby Practices' and I have left a fair amount of my debugging code #'d out ;)

Things I have learned:

- low level networking protocols were not designed with ruby in mind
- tcpdumping packets is the only way to really be sure 
- persistence gets you all things

Note: this has to be run as root permissions because it does funky networking magic.

Peace out,
